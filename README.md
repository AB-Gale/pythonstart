**My first steps on Python and i hope i will succeed**
# Here are some info about this project
Project aimed on leraning of basic fundamentals of Python 


python version 3.14 

**Lesson # 1**
Data Types
int - intger, it stores whole numbers like: 5, 0, -100 

float - is numbers with decimal point like: 44.5, 100.5

str - is string or text type, all about the text

boolean - false or true

command print()

this command uses only with straples - ()

~~Print~~ print, and uses without tabulation 

crucial thing is that, python is reading the code from top to bottom 

it means if we created variable ex: name = john and on the next line we created same virable name = Nick

as a result of print in terminal we get Nick


**Lesson # 2** 
Mathematical logic in python

the main thing is it works as usual math straples are first, multiplication and bla bla bla
